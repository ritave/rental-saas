## TODO  
- Run a check every few minutes or so for changes
- New modification: user abandoned the ship -> this might mean several things:  
    1. clicked "delete" in his calendar -> bring it back with link inside the description that
    will truly allow him to delete the event
    1. declined the event -> just send it again
